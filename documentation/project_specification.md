Project Specification

This project will be coded in Python. I can do peer evaluations in Python only. The project documentation will be in English.

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Chess

The goal of this project is to create a chess game using the Python programming language. The game will have a graphical user interface and will include all the standard chess pieces and rules, including check, checkmate and stalemate.

The game will also use the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI player. The game state will be represented using a 2D array. Each element in the array will represent a square on the chessboard, and the value stored in that element indicates which chess piece, if any, is currently occupying that square.

The program will take input from the players through the graphical user interface, including the movement of pieces and the selection of options such as "castle" or "promote pawn". The program will validate the players' moves and enforce the rules of chess.

The time complexity for the game should be O(n), where n is the total number of possible moves in a given position. The space complexity should be O(1), as the game state will be represented using a 2D array.
