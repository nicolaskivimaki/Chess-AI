## Week 5


### 15.2

Fixed some bugs with the movement of pieces. Added a check to make sure that moves can't be made that would put the player's own queen in check.

### 19.2

Began implementing the minimax algorithm for the opponent's moves in the chess program.


### Total hours: 12

What I will do next:

I will implement the minimax algorithm so that it actually moves pieces. I will add the remaining chess rules to the game (checkmate, en passant, pawn promotion, etc.)
