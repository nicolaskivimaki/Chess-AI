## Week 2

### 26.1

I researched the subject further and came up with a plan for generating the program. I then began to create the main files and drafted a data structure.

### 27.1

I began working on the GUI for the program and created a few files to program the base for the chess board. I decided to use the classic green and white checkered style for the board and also created the chess pieces.

### 29.1

I implemented movement for the pieces by allowing them to be clicked and moved with the mouse. I also generated the basic chess rules to guide the movement of the pieces and determine where they can be moved and where they cannot.

### Total hours: 15

What I will do next:

I will continue to add more functionality to the game and begin working on incorporating the minimax algorithm.
