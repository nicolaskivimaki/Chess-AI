## Week 4

I was sick for most of the week so I wasn't able to get too much done.

### 10.2


Added the movements for the remaining pieces (rooks, knights, queen, king) to the program. Continued testing the game as a whole to ensure all movements and interactions between pieces are functioning correctly. Started checking for checks, mates and stalemates.

### 11.2

Began implementing the minimax algorithm for the opponent's moves in the chess program.


Total hours: 14

What I will do next:

I will continue improving the minimax algorithm. I will also make sure that all chess rules are taken into consideration in the moves (checks, mates, stalemates, pawn promotion).
