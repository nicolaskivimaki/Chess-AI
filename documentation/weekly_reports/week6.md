# Week 6 

## 23.2 

At the start of the week, I reviewed the process I had developed the previous week to determine which chess rules still needed to be implemented into the program.  

### 26.2 

Once I added these new features, I began working on the minimax algorithm. While constructing the algorithm, I encountered a few obstacles, but I was ultimately able to overcome them. At present, the minimax algorithm is nearly complete. 

## What did I find hard this week 

Throughout this week, I encountered some difficulty in determining and monitoring all of the various components required to ensure that this game functions correctly. 

## Total hours: 11

What will I do next week: 

In the upcoming week, I plan to finalize the minimax algorithm and incorporate alpha-beta pruning to enhance its efficiency. Additionally, I will conclude the testing phase.
