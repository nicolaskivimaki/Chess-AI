Continued researching the minimax algorithm and how to implement it in the chess game.

### 5.2

Added CI pipeline. Also started adding movements for the bishops and kings in the game. 

### Total hours: 12

What I will do next:

I will continue to work on the minimax algorithm and further test and debug the game. I will also add more movements for the other pieces and work on improving the overall functionality of the game.
