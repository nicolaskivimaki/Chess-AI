## Week 3

### 3.2

Continued researching the minimax algorithm and how to implement it in the chess game.

### 5.2

Added movements for the bishops and kings in the game. Worked on improving the logic for their movements and ensuring that they are in line with the basic chess rules.

### Total hours: 12

What I will do next:

I will continue to work on the minimax algorithm and further test and debug the game. I will also add more movements for the other pieces and work on improving the overall functionality of the game.
